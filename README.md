🚀 Scalable ETL Pipeline for Business Metrics Processing
📌 Overview
This project implements a scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow and AWS services (S3, Glue, Redshift, Kinesis, Lambda). The goal is to process and analyze business metrics data efficiently, enabling real-time insights.

📌 Use Case
🔹 Problem Statement
Businesses generate vast amounts of data from transactions, user interactions, and operational logs. This project builds a scalable data pipeline that:

Ingests real-time business event logs using AWS Kinesis.
Stores raw data in AWS S3.
Cleans and transforms data using AWS Glue.
Loads processed data into AWS Redshift for analytics.
Automates workflow execution with Apache Airflow.
🔹 Why This Project?
Automates the ETL process with Airflow DAGs.
Supports real-time data ingestion via Kinesis Streams.
Enables large-scale business metric analysis using Redshift.
Deploys infrastructure efficiently using Terraform.
📌 Architecture
🔹 AWS Services Used
Component	Purpose
Apache Airflow	Orchestrates the ETL workflow.
AWS Kinesis	Streams real-time business events.
AWS S3	Stores raw and transformed data.
AWS Glue	Cleans, transforms, and processes data.
AWS Redshift	Stores transformed data for analytics.
AWS Lambda	Triggers transformations on new data arrivals.
Terraform	Automates AWS infrastructure provisioning.
🔹 Workflow Steps
Ingest data into AWS Kinesis from real-time business events.
Store raw data in an AWS S3 bucket.
Trigger AWS Glue to transform and clean the data.
Load cleaned data into AWS Redshift.
Query data in Redshift for analytics.
Airflow DAG automates the entire process.
📌 Data Used
This project uses simulated business transaction data. The dataset includes:

Transaction ID
User ID
Timestamp
Product Category
Purchase Amount
Payment Method
Location (Country, City)
Device Type (Mobile, Desktop, Tablet)
💡 The data is generated using the Faker Python library to mimic real-world transactions.

📌 Key Features
✅ Apache Airflow DAGs automate the ETL workflow.
✅ AWS Kinesis for real-time ingestion of business event logs.
✅ AWS Glue for data transformation and cleaning.
✅ AWS Redshift for analytics-ready data storage.
✅ AWS Lambda for triggering transformations on new data arrivals.
✅ Terraform for automated AWS infrastructure provisioning.

📌 Setup & Installation
🔹 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

AWS CLI (Configured with IAM permissions)
Terraform
Apache Airflow
Python 3.x (with required dependencies)
🔹 Steps to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/PranithJain98/airflow-etl-project.git
cd airflow-etl-project
2️⃣ Set Up Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Start Apache Airflow
bash
Copy
Edit
airflow db init
airflow scheduler
airflow webserver --port 8080
5️⃣ Deploy AWS Infrastructure with Terraform
bash
Copy
Edit
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
6️⃣ Trigger Airflow DAG
Open Airflow UI at http://localhost:8080
Enable and trigger the DAG etl_pipeline_s3_redshift
📌 Expected Results
After running the ETL pipeline, you can query business metrics from AWS Redshift.

🔹 Example Queries
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Total Sales by Product Category
SELECT product_category, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_sales
FROM business_data
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Top 5 Payment Methods Used
SELECT payment_method, COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
FROM business_data
GROUP BY payment_method
ORDER BY transaction_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
💡 These queries help businesses analyze user spending patterns and optimize marketing strategies.

📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add Amazon QuickSight dashboards for better visualization.
🔹 Implement error handling & logging for pipeline failures.
🔹 Optimize AWS Glue transformations for faster processing.
